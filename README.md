A compilation of creative coding experiments inspired by Domestika course "Creative Coding: Making visuals with Javascript" by Bruno Imbrizi.

Baby steps to object oriented-programming. Each agent is an object moving independently from the others. When two agents approach in a predefined distance, a line is connecting them. Agents, when the reach the limits of the canvas, can either disappear or can bounce back.

Here we are using Perlin noise and look how beautiful results! Pay attention and be patient!

Experimenting with text and pixel manipulation. 
I got creative and had fun with a photo of my cat. :heart_eyes_cat::heart_eyes_cat::heart_eyes_cat:
