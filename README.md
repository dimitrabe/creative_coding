# creative_coding
A compilation of creative coding experiments inspired by Domestika course "Creative Coding: Making visuals with Javascript" by Bruno Imbrizi.

## Grid of rectangles
The first step was to create a grid of rectangles, pulsing, seemingly changing the frame size but in reality a second rectangle is drawn nested inside the original rectangle randomly.

## Arcs and rectangles
Experimentations with translate, rotate and restore using arches.

## Bubbles everywhere
Baby steps to object oriented-programming. Each agent is an object moving independently from the others. When two agents approach in a predefined distance, a line is connecting them. Agents, when the reach the limits of the canvas, can either disappear or can bounce back.

## Noise
:musical_note: :musical_note: White noise, what an awful sound... :musical_note: :musical_note: 

Here we are using Perlin noise and look how beautiful results! Pay attention and be patient!

## Pixel magic
Experimenting with text and pixel manipulation. 
I got creative and had fun with a photo of my cat. :heart_eyes_cat::heart_eyes_cat::heart_eyes_cat:

## Final project

The final project was a mix of all the above inspired by a post I saw on Pinterest and I can no longer find. 
The concept is that the screen is full of eyes and they are following the movement of the cursor. 
When the cursor is touching an eye, the eye is becoming red.

Thebackground is black. Inside of each circle, there is another smaller black circle that moves based on the movement of the mouse cursor. When the cursor is inside the circle, the smaller circle becomes red.">
